# --- the wedge threshold consults the worker's own declared wait ------------
# Upstream kunchenguid/firstmate#3909 and #2614: wedge_timer_check escalated on
# elapsed idle time alone, without ever asking whether the worker had already
# said why its pane was quiet. Nothing re-consulted that declaration once the
# timer was running, so the ladder climbed for as long as the wait lasted and
# each escalation cost a supervising turn. Past FM_WEDGE_DEMAND_INSPECT_COUNT
# every repeat also carried demand-deep-inspection, which by its own wording
# forbids re-absorbing on the run-step or pane state, so the supervisor could not
# even use the evidence that was there.
#
# Both directions are pinned in each case below, because a bound that only
# proves the quiet direction would be indistinguishable from simply deleting
# wedge detection: the lane WITHOUT a declaration must keep the identical
# schedule, escalation count, reason and demand-deep-inspection wording.

# Run one watcher round against a lane whose pane is already stably stale at the
# recorded hash - the population wedge_timer_check owns. FM_STALE_ESCALATE_SECS=1
# puts every round at the threshold, so a round either escalates or is deferred;
# the real 240s default only changes how long that takes.
# <mode> `exit` requires the watcher to surface and exit, `absorb` requires it to
# survive whole poll cycles at the threshold. Returns 1 when it does the other.
# The endpoint this lane's window resolves to is a live grok agent unless a case
# drives it elsewhere with FM_TEST_PANE_COMMAND (the pane's foreground command)
# and FM_TEST_TMUX_WINDOWS (the session inventory the recorded window must appear
# in), which is how the dead-endpoint cases below reach `dead` and `missing`.

# --- a record whose agent is GONE reports once, instead of alarming forever ---
# Observed on a live fleet: two finished lanes reached 226 and 203 CONSECUTIVE
# wedge escalations, one alarm roughly every FM_STALE_ESCALATE_SECS, indefinitely -
# from lanes with no agent running at all. `bin/fm-control.sh <id> exit` answered
# `already-stopped` and `bin/fm-crew-state.sh` read `failed - run failed`. Closing
# the pane did not stop it either: with the pane gone (`herdr pane read` ->
# `pane_not_found`) the count still climbed, because the poll is driven by the
# durable record's `window=` line, not by the pane. The escalate path clears its
# own idle timer and re-arms with nothing bounding the count, and a dead agent's
# pane never churns to reset it, so the ladder had no ceiling. The cost is not the
# repetition: it is that ~400 notifications a day from two finished lanes drown
# the alarms that matter, and the captain stopped reading them.
#
# fm_backend_agent_state already separated an agent that is THINKING from one that
# is gone; the escalation path simply never asked it. Both directions are pinned
# below, for the reason the declared-wait cases above give: a bound proved only in
# the quiet direction is indistinguishable from deleting wedge detection.
# Related, and deliberately NOT closed by this: upstream #4412, #4482, #4316.

# The two endpoint verdicts that are PROOF an agent is gone, as the lane fixture
# above reaches them: `dead` is the recorded window still present in the session
# inventory with a bare shell in front of it (the husk a crashed agent leaves),
