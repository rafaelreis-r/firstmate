# is harness-independent positive evidence the crew is still executing - the same

# churning pane is benign. The pane going quiet afterwards is still caught by that
# backbone, which is why this widens the proof rather than bounding the wake rate.

# The pane-churn turn-end absorb is opt-in per home, so every case that exercises
# it (whether it expects an absorb or one of the guards that must still surface)

# must land without re-marking the window. The macos-stock-bash CI lane runs
